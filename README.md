# Signer-Diarization-Internship
OpenPose Signer Diarization.ipynb contains the set up and setings for extracting keypoints and images from the sign language videos. For use with Google Colab, it is generally best to divide the videos into clips of around 5 minutes.
Signer Diarization LSTM.ipynb performs the preprocessing using JSON Parser.py and Data Preprocessing.py. It then contains the two experiments described in the paper, which can be run separately.
